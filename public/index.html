        <p>The Chicago Chicago Golf League is a cooperative league for golfers of all skill levels in the Chicagoland area. Our league scheduling system matches golfers with compatible availability to play 9 holes together as a team of two. Instead of a more competitive format based on solo stroke play, we play “Chicago”, a format that rewards both new players and experienced golfers willing to take risks. New and casual players are always welcome and much appreciated.</p>

        <p>The CCGL operates as a weekly team tournament, in which teams of two play 9 hole rounds with each other and post a combined score using the Chicago format described below. The team with the best score for the week is crowned champion, with all the rights and privileges pertaining thereto, until the completion of the next week’s tournament. The tournaments run from the first week in April to the last week in September.</p>

        <p>Each week, new teams are chosen using our online scheduling system. Members who are available to play at particular times and courses and matched up with other members with the same availability. Players can adjust their availability online and choose how much they want to play. So whether it’s a few times a season or a few times a week...it’s up to them to choose their schedule.</p>

        <p>Teams play together, encouraging and supporting each other as they make their way around the course. They can help each other read greens, strategize on each hole, and share local knowledge about the course. Each player keeps track of the other player’s score, which is submitted both for team points and a personal handicap used in future score calculations.</p>

        <h2>Chicago Format</h2>
        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-lg-8">
            <p>Chicago is a “points” format where high scores are good. Instead of counting every stroke on every hole, you earn points based on the number of strokes you take on each hole. That means each hole is a new chance at glory, and one bad hole can't mess up your entire round.</p>

            <p>Additionally, each player starts with a number of points based on their handicap. Better players start with fewer points, and new players automatically get the maximum number of starting points allowed (the exact amount is based on the course you're playing). The team score you'll post for that round is just the sum of your two scores.</p>

            <p>Don't worry about keeping track of all of this, though. The CCGL online scoring system does almost all of the work of calculating these points for you. All you need to do is select the course and tees you played, and enter the score for your playing partner. The point total then will be immediately available on the CCGL website.</p>

        <p>In case you <em>do</em> want the full details, let's walk through a scoring example. Assume we have two players, Alice and Bob. Bob is a new golfer with a handicap index of 36. Alice is an experienced golfer with a handicap index of 8. They’re playing 9 holes off the blue tees at Robert A. Black, which has a slope rating of 100. This gives Bob a course handicap of 32, and Alice a course handicap of 7. These values are divided in half because they’re only playing 9 holes, so Bob starts with 16 points and Alice starts with 3. Here are their scores for the round:</p>

            <p><em>Alice played well, but her biggest contribution to her team’s score was helping Bob feel comfortable playing this course for the first time. His par on the 4th hole and string of subsequent bogeys made a big difference for their team.</em></p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>Alice got one birdie (4 points), four pars (8 points), three bogeys (3 points), and one double bogey (0 points), adding 15 points to her score. Bob had a great first round, and got three bogeys (3 points), one par (2 points), and five double bogeys (0 points), adding 5 points to his score. This gives Alice and Bob a total team score of 39 points (18 + 21).</p>

        <p>When Alice and Bob post their scores, the CCGL scoring system will immediately update their handicap indexes. So the next time Bob plays, his starting points will be slightly lower. If Bob and Alice had time to play 18 holes that day (or on two different days), both the front and the back 9 would be scored separately. The highest of the two scores would count as their total for the week. Each team exists as a unique entity, so if Alice or Bob play 9 holes with someone else in the league this week, those scores for those pairings would be treated independently.</p>

        <p>While our events are always played by the strict rules of golf, the CCGL handicapping system diverges from the USGA in the following ways:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>New members without an official USGA handicap are assigned a handicap index of 36.</li>
          <li>The CCGL Equitable Stroke Control is greatly simplified. No player can post a score higher than double bogey on any hole (zero points in the Chicago format).</li>
          <li>Only one posted round is required to calculate a handicap index. The lowest score of your first five rounds is used to calculate the index. After 5 rounds, the standard USGA method applies for selecting which rounds are included.</li>

        <h3>Golf is Broken. We're Fixing It.</h3>
        <p>Golf, it's time for an intervention. We love you, and we need you to stop. Stop ruining our weekly golf outing with a quadruple bogey on the third hole. Stop wasting our weekends with 18 hole rounds that take 6 hours. Stop isolating us with solo competition. Stop pretending like stroke play is the only way to play "real" golf.</p>

        </div>
        <p>Nobody designing a game from scratch today would do things like this. Let's leave tradition behind while keeping the essential elements that make golf great. Let's take joy in a well struck 7 iron that pipes toward the pin, in the crushed drive that sets up a chance at birdie, and the miracle sand save for par. Let's leave behind stroke play for something that lets us take risks and rewards us when we succeed. Let's play golf <em>together</em>, not simply as a collection of people who happen to be playing the same hole at the same time.</p>
