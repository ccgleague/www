        <p>The Chicago Chicago Golf League is a cooperative league for golfers of all skill levels in the Chicagoland area. Each week, from April to September, our league scheduling system matches golfers with compatible availability to play rounds of 9 holes together as a team of two. Instead of an individual format based on stroke play, we play “Chicago”, a tournament format that rewards both new players and experienced golfers willing to take risks. This means that new and casual players are always welcome and much appreciated.</p>

        <p>When you sign up, you'll set a playing schedule, and pick local courses where you can easily play. Each week you'll get an email matching you with other members of the league who can play at the same time and location as you. The two of you will play as a team and submit a combined score for that week's tournament. Each player in a team keeps track of the other player’s score, which is submitted both for team points and a personal handicap used in future score calculations.</p> 
        
        <p>You can play multiple times per week, with different teammates or the same. You can also change your availability at any time to adjust how much you want to play. So whether it’s a few times a season, a few times a week, or...it depends...you can play as much as you like.</p>

        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-lg-8">
            <p>Chicago is a “points” format where high scores are good. Instead of counting every stroke on every hole, you earn points based on the number of strokes you take on each hole. The lowest score is zero (double bogey), so a few bad shots won't ruin your whole round.</p>

            <p>Additionally, each player starts with a number of points based on their handicap. Better players start with fewer points, and new players automatically get the maximum number of starting points allowed (the exact amount is based on the course you're playing). Your team's score is just the sum of all the points you both scored that round.</p>

            <p>Don't worry about keeping track of all of this, though. The CCGL online scoring system does almost all of the work of calculating these points for you. All you need to do is select the course you played, and enter the number of strokes for your playing partner on each hole. The point total then will be immediately calculated available on the CCGL website.</p>

        <h5>Scoring Example</h5>

        <p>In case you <em>do</em> want the full details, let's walk through a scoring example. Assume we have two players, Alice and Bob. Bob is a new golfer with a handicap index of 36. Alice is an experienced golfer with a handicap index of 8. They’re playing 9 holes off the blue tees at Robert A. Black, which has a slope rating of 100. This gives Bob a course handicap of 32, and Alice a course handicap of 7. These values are divided in half because they’re only playing 9 holes, so Bob starts with 16 points and Alice starts with 3. Here are their scores for the round:</p>

                </tr>
              </tbody>
            </table>
          </div>
          <div class="col-lg-4">
            <p>Alice got one birdie (4 points), four pars (8 points), three bogeys (3 points), and one double bogey (0 points), adding 15 points to her score. Bob had a great first round, and got three bogeys (3 points), one par (2 points), and five double bogeys (0 points), adding 5 points to his score. This gives Alice and Bob a total team score of 39 points (18 + 21).</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <p>When Alice and Bob post their scores, the CCGL scoring system will immediately update their handicap indexes. So the next time Bob plays, his starting points will be slightly lower. If Bob and Alice had time to play 18 holes that day (or on two different days), both the front and the back 9 would be scored separately. The highest of the two scores would count as their total for the week. Each team exists as a unique combination, so if Alice or Bob play 9 holes with someone else in the league this week, those scores for those pairings would be treated independently.</p>

        <h5>Handicap</h5>

        <p>While our events are always played by the strict rules of golf, the CCGL handicapping system diverges from the USGA in the following ways:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>New members without an official USGA handicap are assigned a handicap index of 36.</li>
          <li>The CCGL Equitable Stroke Control is greatly simplified. No player can post a score higher than double bogey on any hole (zero points in the Chicago format).</li>
          <li>Only one posted round is required to calculate a handicap index. The lowest score of your first five rounds is used to calculate the index. After 5 rounds, the standard USGA method applies for selecting which rounds are included.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>A New Way To Play</h3>
        <p>Golf, it's time for an intervention. We love you, and we need you to stop. Stop ruining our weekly golf outing with a quadruple bogey on the third hole. Stop wasting our weekends with 18 hole rounds that take 6 hours. Stop isolating us with solo competition. Stop pretending like stroke play is the only way to play "real" golf.</p>
        <div class="card mb-3 text-center">
          <h5 class="card-body mx-auto text-center"><strong>It doesn't have to be this way. We can do things differently.</strong></h5>
        </div>
        <p>Imagine if you designed a game like golf today. Let's leave tradition behind while keeping the essential elements that make it fun. Let's take joy in a well struck 7 iron that pipes toward the pin, in the crushed drive that sets up a chance at birdie, and the miracle sand save for par. Let's leave behind stroke play for something that lets us take risks and rewards us when we succeed. Let's play golf <em>together</em>, not simply as a collection of people who happen to be playing the same hole at the same time.</p>
